![Wearable BCI with BLE connectivity]({{ '/images/wearbableBCI_ble.jpg' | relative_url }})

A series of wearable EEG acquisition systems designed for practical brain-computer interface applications outside the laboratory.

## WiFi/BLE EEG Systems

- **Hardware:** ADS1299-based acquisition front-end with WiFi/BLE wireless streaming
- **Firmware:** NRF52832/NRF5340 platform with custom low-latency protocols
- **Software:** PC host application and Unity integration for real-time BCI

## Ear-EEG Wearable

- **Form Factor:** Swappable earcup module with miniaturized EEG sensors
- **Chip:** NRF52832 + KS1092 for compact, low-power operation
- **Application:** Companion mobile app for daily cognitive monitoring

## Commercialization

Co-founded GuoKe XinNao (Shanghai) to bring ear-EEG wearables to market, focusing on practical BCI applications for everyday use.
