## Publication Details

**Authors:** H. Liu, Z. Zhu, Z. Wang, et al.

**Venue:** Moore and More, 2024

**DOI:** [10.1007/s44275-024-00017-w](https://doi.org/10.1007/s44275-024-00017-w)

## Abstract

We engineered a modular EEG acquisition architecture combining FPGA preprocessing, standardized analog front ends, and scalable analytics APIs. The platform supports laboratory studies and clinical deployments that require synchronized high-density recordings with rapid algorithm iteration.

## Key Contributions

- **FPGA-based modular architecture** for high-throughput EEG acquisition
- **Standardized analog front ends** with scalable channel counts
- **Real-time preprocessing pipeline** for rapid algorithm development
- **Support for both research and clinical deployments** with synchronized multi-channel recording

## System Features

- High-density synchronized recordings
- Modular design for easy expansion
- Real-time signal processing capabilities
- Flexible API for algorithm integration
