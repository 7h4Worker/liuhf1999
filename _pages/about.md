Ph.D. candidate at ShanghaiTech University & SARI (CAS) in XR-based brain-computer interfaces. Research integrates VEP paradigm design, wearable neural sensing, and embedded system deployment toward practical BCIs.

## Research Interests

- **VR/AR SSVEP Paradigms:** Binocular encoding schemes for immersive multi-target interfaces with improved throughput and visual comfort
- **End-to-End BCI Systems:** Unity-based platforms connecting stimulus, neural decoding, and closed-loop control (drones, robotic arms, vehicles)
- **Wearable Sensing:** Wireless EEG systems and ear-EEG prototypes for mobile, daily-life BCI applications
- **Future:** Toward neural interfaces that blend seamlessly into XR headsets—adaptive sensing, real-time state inference, and on-device intelligence

## Highlights
- Published papers in IEEE JBHI, JNE, Frontiers in Neuroscience, etc., with 3 first-author and 1 co-first-author publications
- XR-BCI prototype systems and multi-user BCI interaction prototype ("Internet of Brains")
- Third Prize at 2025 Brain-Computer Interface Conference (brain-controlled vehicle and robotic arm, Team Leader)
