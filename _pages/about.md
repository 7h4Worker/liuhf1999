Ph.D. candidate at ShanghaiTech University and Shanghai Advanced Research Institute (CAS) focusing on XR-based brain-computer interfaces. Research centers on VEP paradigms in VR/AR, wearable physiological sensing, and embedded system development for practical BCIs. Seeking to advance XR-BCI through co-evolution of novel interfaces and edge intelligence, toward next-generation personal terminals enabling Internet of Brains.

## Research Interests

- **VR/AR SSVEP Paradigms:** Binocular encoding schemes for immersive multi-target interfaces with improved throughput and visual comfort
- **End-to-End BCI Systems:** Unity-based platforms connecting stimulus, neural decoding, and closed-loop control (drones, robotic arms, vehicles)
- **Wearable Sensing:** Wireless EEG systems and ear-EEG prototypes for mobile, daily-life BCI applications
- **Future:** Toward neural interfaces that blend seamlessly into XR headsets—adaptive sensing, real-time state inference, and on-device intelligence

## Highlights
- Co-founded a startup to commercialize ear-EEG wearables
- Bronze medals at 2025 China BCI Competition (brain-controlled car and robotic arm)
- Multi-user AR-BCI brain-networking demos
