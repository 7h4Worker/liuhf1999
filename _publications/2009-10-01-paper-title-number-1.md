Abstract

Steady-state visual evoked potential brain-computer interfaces (SSVEP-BCI)
have attracted significant attention due to their ease of deployment and high
performance in terms of information transfer rate (ITR) and accuracy, making
them a promising candidate for integration with consumer electronics devices.
However, as SSVEP characteristics are directly associated with visual stimulus
attributes, the influence of stereoscopic vision on SSVEP as a critical visual
attribute has yet to be fully explored. Meanwhile, the promising combination of
virtual reality (VR) devices and BCI applications is hampered by the significant
disparity between VR environments and traditional 2D displays. This is not only
due to the fact that screen-based SSVEP generally operates under static, stable
conditions with simple and unvaried visual stimuli but also because conventional
luminance-modulated stimuli can quickly induce visual fatigue. This study
attempts to address these research gaps by designing SSVEP paradigms with
stereo-related attributes and conducting a comparative analysis with the
traditional 2D planar paradigm under the same VR environment. This study
proposed two new paradigms: the 3D paradigm and the 3D-Blink paradigm. The
3D paradigm induces SSVEP by modulating the luminance of spherical targets,
while the 3D-Blink paradigmemploysmodulation of the spheres’ opacity instead.
The results of o	ine 4-object selection experiments showed that the accuracy
of 3D and 2D paradigmwas 85.67 and 86.17%with canonical correlation analysis
(CCA) and 86.17 and 91.73% with filter bank canonical correlation analysis
(FBCCA), which is consistent with the reduction in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
of SSVEP harmonics for the 3D paradigm observed in the frequency-domain
analysis. The 3D-Blink paradigm achieved 75.00% of detection accuracy and
27.02 bits/min of ITR with 0.8 seconds of stimulus time and task-related
component analysis (TRCA) algorithm, demonstrating its e􀀀ectiveness. These
findings demonstrate that the 3D and 3D-Blink paradigms supported by VR
can achieve improved user comfort and satisfactory performance, while further
algorithmic optimization and feature analysis are required for the stereo-related
paradigms. In conclusion, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of
the impact of binocular stereoscopic vision mechanisms on SSVEP paradigms
and promotes the application of SSVEP-BCI in diverse VR environments.
