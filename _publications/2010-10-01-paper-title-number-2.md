**Abstract**

This paper presents a novel method for modulating
steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) based on binocular
vision in virtual reality (VR). The method involves displaying
monocular frequencies in the left and right view of VR to
encode nine binocular targets using only two frequencies. We
constructed a VR-BCI system and validated the effectiveness
of this binocular-encoded paradigm through the task-related
component analysis (TRCA) algorithm, which is a supervised
approach based on individual templates. The results showed a
recognition accuracy of 79.05% and an information transfer rate
(ITR) of 43.38 bits/min with a data length of 2 seconds. The
electroencephalography (EEG) responses of the binocular combinations
exhibited unique characteristics compared to traditional
SSVEP, suggesting potential for further optimization in terms
of performance. This proposed method reduces the frequency
requirements for encoding SSVEP-speller and highlights the
potential of VR-BCI in utilizing binocular characteristics, which
could contribute to the practicality and high-speed implementation
of SSVEP-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems.
