**Abstract**

Objective. To enhance frequency recognition in Steady-State Visual
Evoked Potential (SSVEP)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), particularly
under short data acquisition and complex environmental conditions. Approach. We
propose Multi-Stimulus Discriminant Fusion Analysis (MSDFA), a novel method
that integrates multi-stimulus strategies with discriminant modeling. MSDFA was
evaluated on two public datasets (Benchmark and BETA) and compared with
conventional approaches including eCCA, eTRCA, and their variants. Main results.
MSDFA consistently outperformed existing methods across different data lengths
and training block quantities. It achieved maximum information transfer rates of
247.17±10.15 bpm on the Benchmark dataset and 192.72±9.44 bpm on the BETA
dataset, demonstrating superior robustness and efficiency. Significance. By combining
complementary algorithmic strengths, MSDFA improves adaptability to individual
variability and complex environments, advancing the practical utility and reliability of
SSVEP-BCI systems.
