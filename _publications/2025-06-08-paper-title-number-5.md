**Abstract**

This paper presents a novel binocular-encoded
SSVEP (beSSVEP) method, leveraging binocular vision in virtual
reality (VR) to enhance brain-computer interface (BCI)
applications. We introduce the Binocular Periodically Repeated
Component Analysis (bPRCA) algorithm, designed to address
the unique characteristics of binocular-encoded targets, which
include combinations of monocular single-frequency SSVEP units
or void units, with frequency units being reused multiple times
in the encoded interface. To further optimize performance, we
propose the Fusion Component Analysis (FusionCA) framework,
which integrates bPRCA with Task-related Component
Analysis (TRCA), effectively utilizing both steady-state periodic
components and cross-trial aperiodic components. Experimental
results demonstrate that ensemble-FusionCA achieves the highest
information transfer rate (ITR) with an average accuracy of
71.39% and an ITR of 138.50 bits/min at 0.4 seconds, among the
comparison with ensemble-bPRCA and ensemble-TRCA. Compared
to traditional SSVEP approaches, beSSVEP significantly
enhances frequency utilization, making VR-BCI systems more
efficient and practical. This study highlights the application of
physiological mechanisms of binocular vision to improve BCI
systems, offering a new perspective for developing fast and
scalable brain-computer interactions in VR environments.
